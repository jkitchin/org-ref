* Sequential Footnote Numbering Demonstration

This document demonstrates how org-ref assigns sequential footnote numbers
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5...) to DIFFERENT citations when using =footcite= commands.
Each footcite gets the next number regardless of which reference is cited.

* Sequential Numbering Demonstration

** First Citation

The theory of relativity revolutionized physics.[[footcite:&einstein1905]]

** Second Citation (Different Reference)

Shannon's information theory laid the foundation for digital
communications.[[footcite:&shannon1948]]

** Third Citation (Another Different Reference)

The TeXbook is the definitive guide to TeX typesetting.[[footcite:&knuth1984]]

** Fourth Citation (Yet Another Reference)

LaTeX simplified document preparation for technical
writing.[[footcite:&lamport1986]]

** Fifth Citation (One More Reference)

Data sharing is essential for reproducible
research.[[footcite:&kitchin-2015-examp-effec]]

* Repeating a Citation

When you cite the same reference again, it gets a new footnote
number.[[footcite:&einstein1905]]

Note that this second citation of Einstein's paper gets footnote number 6,
not number 1.

* Mixed Citation Types

You can mix regular citations with footnote citations:

** Regular Citation (Inline)

This is a regular inline citation: [[cite:&shannon1948]].

** Footnote Citation

And here is a footnote citation.[[footcite:&knuth1984]]

** Another Regular Citation

Another inline: [[cite:&lamport1986]].

** Another Footnote

And another footnote.[[footfullcite:&einstein1905]]

* What You Should See

When this document is exported to HTML, ODT, or DOCX:

1. Each =footcite= or =footfullcite= appears as a superscript number
2. The numbers are sequential: [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]
3. Each number links to the full citation at the bottom
4. Regular =cite= links appear as inline citations (e.g., [1])
5. A bibliography appears at the end with all references

* Expected Footnote Sequence

Based on the citations above, the footnote numbering should be:

| Footnote | Reference     | Type          |
|----------+---------------+---------------|
| [1]      | einstein1905  | footcite      |
| [2]      | shannon1948   | footcite      |
| [3]      | knuth1984     | footcite      |
| [4]      | lamport1986   | footcite      |
| [5]      | kitchin-2015  | footcite      |
| [6]      | einstein1905  | footcite      |
| [7]      | knuth1984     | footcite      |
| [8]      | einstein1905  | footfullcite  |

* About the IEEE Style

The IEEE style is a numeric citation style that:
- Uses numbers [1], [2], [3] for citations
- Supports footnotes when =class="note"= is specified
- Provides concise, numbered references
- Is widely used in engineering and computer science
